		### PLAIN TEXT ENHANCED 
		### FORMATTING GUIDE    
		########################


		### HEADINGS AND LINES

Use '#' characters to make headings.
This works at the beginning of a line and after tab characters (not after spaces).
There has to be a space after the '#' character.

	### HEADING 1
	3x#: bold, dark text, solid highlight

	## HEADING 2
	2x#: bold, colour, faint highlight

	# HEADING 3
	1x#: just colour

	This will also work:	## I'm so tabulous
	It just needs a tab.


## LINES

Use any simbol to make coloured lines, repeating it three or more times adds colour.
Same rules apply as for headings (it works at the beginning of a line and after tab characters (not after spaces)).

	========  ********  xxxxxxxx  oooooooo

	········  --------  ––––––––  ————————

	# NICE FOR UNDERLINING HEADINGS!
	'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

	This will work	==== Yeah! (after a tab)
	But this won't ==== Nope. (after a space)

	Tip: these lines also colour the rest of the text in their line
	=== They can be used as custom headings, separators, etc. ===

To make "thick"/"solid" (highlighted) lines use '#' (also three or more times).

	# SUPER DUPER IMPORTANT
	######################### <- There are many '#' characters here.

	It won't affect your XXX needs within text after spaces ;)


		### LISTS

Use these symbols to make lists (or other things):
Same rules apply (works at beginning of lines and after tabs but not after spaces).

	* asterisk
	· middot
	• bullet
	+ plus
	- hyphen/minus
	– en dash
	— em dash
	~ squiggly thing
	> "more than", but let's call it arrow lipsum.com

	This will work	* Yay (after a tab)
	But this won't * Nay (after a space)
	Also works after text and needs a tab	> Probably useless


		### SPECIAL

'<>' will also get formatted — same rules apply. It can have 0–3 characters inside.

## LISTS WITH NUMBERS OR LETTERS

Use numbers or letters and parantheses to make ordered/prioritised lists.
Same rules apply (works at beginning of lines and after tabs but not after spaces).

	1) Survival
	2) Shelter
	(1) Two parantheses also work
	(65536) Numbers can have any length

	A) top priority
	(B) lower priority
	AA) Letters have to be single


## ITEMS WITH NAMES

Use brackets to make items with custom names. Anythingcan go inside except whitespaces.
Same rules apply (works at beginning of lines and after tabs but not after spaces).

	[thought] I want to lick the text. It's so beautiful.
	[note] Don't lick the text.


## IMPORTANT ITEMS

Use '+' or '!' or '?' or '@' to make red items. The first character must be a letter.
This works anywhere, and needs empty space before it (new line, space or tab) and one or more characters after it.

Examples:

	+to-do Write beautiful text
	!important Another example of something
	?research Write beautiful text
	@cafe Another example of something
	Some standard text +reminder
	Some standard text @today-22:15

Use two of those symbols to make items purple. Same rules apply.

	++reminder 17:30 — practice enjoying text
	!!important
	??ask
	@@tag description


		### OTHER FORMATTING

## COMMENTS

Use '//' to make a comment.
This works anywhere, even after other items but needs an empty space before it (new line, space or tab).
asdasdasdsad // tetet
	// This is a comment
	Some standard text // All text is awesome


## SECTIONS OR QUOTES

Use '|' to begin a separated section of text like in the example below.	* test
This works the beginnings of lines and after tab characters.

	* list
	* something else

[note] Some really important text
+to-do Sleeep tonight
@contact Mr. Typesalot
++buy The world

|	"Be one with the text"

|											
|	"One cannot know the true joy of		
|	witnessing beauty if one has not		
|	 layed eyes upon sexy text"				
| 		— Sir Swiftfingers of Typesalot		
|											

Any character has a background inside, so you can create a rectangular background using tabs and spaces.


## NUMBERS

	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
	1234567890
	-1/2=-0.5
	1a (adjacent letters turn numbers into text)

## URL's

Works with www, http:// and https://
Minimum: ab.cb · http://a.b · https://a.b (requires character dot character)

	website.com
	www.website.com
	http://website.com
	https://www.website.com text after URL is not formatted !tag special items still get formatted // Comments still get formatted


## EMPHASIS

# BOLD AND ITALIC
Surround text with '*' to bold it or '_' to italicise it.
This works anywhere after an empty space.
For bold and italics, the first and last character inside the symbols ('*' and '_') must not be a space or tab characters. Highlight accepts these.

	Text is important for *writing down ideas*!
	It is even _more important_ for *transferring knowledge and information*!
	But it is _most important_ for it to be ^gorgeous^


# HIGHLIGHT
Surround a text with '^' to highlight it.
This works anywhere after an empty space.
