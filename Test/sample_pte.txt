	## PHYSICAL TEXT ADDICTION

A quote from *ITAA* (International Text Addiction Association):

| "Addiction to beautiful text is a serious and growing issue in our modern digital world.
| Every day, we see more and more people fall victim to the beauty of formatted text.
| 
| While text addiction has never been an issue with plain text, beautifully formatted
| text has some serious side effects on the brains of victims, similar
| to those of ^long-term meth abuse^.

|| Because of the widespread issue of addiction to beautiful text, laws have been made to force
|| syntax highlighting schemes to implement features that let users write unformatted text.

` Unformatted sections remove all formatting to protect your health
`` *Bold*, _italic_, www.website.com and others may look boring, but are safer for you.
