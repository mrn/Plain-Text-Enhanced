# About

2024 update: I still use this, but don't have time to maintain it. It's in the back of my mind to put it on package control.

Plain Text Enhanced is a syntax highlighting scheme for taking notes in plain text files using Sublime Text.

PTE has useful formatting features to make note-taking more sophisticated and to make notes much more readable.

Imagine markdown but instead of the purpose to be rendered to HTML, it was designed for taking notes.

# Example

# Setup

I don't have time to put this on Package Control, so here's a manual installation guide:

1) Move the `Plain Text Enhanced` folder into Sublime Text's `Packages` folder.
(Open it with `Preferences > Browse Packages...`).

2) Inside the new `Plain Text Enahnced` folder, rename the file `ColorSchemeName.sublime-color-scheme` to the name of your active color scheme.
For example: `Monokai.sublime-color-scheme`.

3) Optional: you can add the key bindings from the file `KeyBindings.sublime-keymap` into Sublime's key bindings settings (`Preferences > Key Bindings`). These are not documented, but if you can read the config file they can be helpful.

I hope you find Plain Text Enhanced useful!
